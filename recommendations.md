   > *Sources: Kenya Met (API), NASA (Satellite), TAHMO (Ground Sensors)*

***A simplified version:***

## Data Pipeline Architecture

Here’s a simplified form of the AI-powered weather app's data pipeline:

![Data Pipeline Architecture](images/data-pipeline-architecture-simplified-form.png)

**Key Components:**

1. Ingestion: Airflow fetches data daily at 6AM EAT
2. Storage: TimescaleDB for time-series efficiency
3. Serving: Model outputs cached in Redis for low-latency

### **Appendix D: Risk Mitigation Plan for Data Outages**  

| Risk                          | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 | Backup Solution                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Kenya Met API downtime        | Cache last 30 days of data; use ICPAC satellite data as fallback                    | Manual CSV upload from KMD email reports     |
| Sensor network failure        | Deploy 5 low-cost AWS IoT LoRaWAN gateways in key counties                          | Citizen reports via USSD/SMS                 |
| Cloud provider outage        | Multi-region deployment (AWS Africa + Europe)                                       | Local server at University of Nairobi        |
| Model drift                  | Weekly retraining with new data                                                     | Rule-based fallback (historical averages)    |
| Internet connectivity issues | Offline-first app design; sync when connection resumes                              | Pre-loaded seasonal trends for each county   |

**Sample Questions:**  

1. **Current Practices**
   - "How do you currently check weather forecasts? (Radio/SMS/Neighbors/Other)"  
   - "What weather info is most critical for your farming decisions?"  

2. **App Feedback**  
   - "Would you prefer forecasts via SMS, app, or voice call?"  
   - "How many days ahead do you need rainfall predictions?" (Circle: 1/3/7/14)  

3. **Willingness to Pay**  
   - "Would you pay 5 KES/day for flood alerts? (Yes/No/Maybe)"  
   - "What’s your preferred payment method? (MPESA/Airtel Money/Cash)"  

**Implementation Tips:**  

- Conduct interviews in Swahili/Kikuyu  
- Offer 50MB airtime for participation

|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| VM Instance (4vCPU)    | $70 (t3.xlarge)        | $65 (n2-standard-4)   | **GCP** (cheaper)         |
| Object Storage (100GB) | $2.30 (S3)             | $2.00 (Cloud Storage) | **GCP**                  |
| PostgreSQL Database    | $90 (RDS)              | $77 (Cloud SQL)       | **GCP**                  |
| AI Training (GPU)      | $1.10/hr (p3.2xlarge)  | $0.95/hr (T4)         | **GCP**                  |
| Data Transfer OUT      | $0.09/GB (First 10TB)  | $0.12/GB              | **AWS** (Lower egress)   |
| Local Presence         | AWS Africa (Cape Town) | GCP Johannesburg      | **AWS** (Lower latency)  |

**Key Findings:**  

- **GCP is 15-20% cheaper** for compute/storage  
- **AWS has better Africa network performance**  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Use GCP for model training + AWS for app serving
